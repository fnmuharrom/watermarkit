# Watermark App - Project Summary

## Overview
A Next.js web application that allows users to upload images, add customizable watermarks, and download the watermarked result - all client-side without database interaction.

## Core Features
1. **Image Upload**
    - Drag-and-drop or file selection interface
    - Support for common image formats (JPG, PNG, WebP)

2. **Watermark Customization**
    - Orientation selection (horizontal/vertical)
    - Font size adjustment via slider
    - Color selection from 10 predefined options
    - Opacity control via slider

3. **Live Preview**
    - Real-time visualization of watermark changes
    - Responsive preview area

4. **Download Functionality**
    - High-quality image export
    - Preserves original image dimensions

## Technical Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 14+ with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui
- **Image Processing**: Canvas API (client-side)
- **State Management**: React hooks (useState, useEffect)

## Implementation Flow
1. User uploads an image through the interface
2. Image is loaded into a canvas element for processing
3. User adjusts watermark properties using controls
4. Watermark is applied in real-time to the preview canvas
5. User downloads the final watermarked image

## Component Structure
- `ImageUploader`: Handles image input and validation
- `WatermarkControls`: Contains all customization options
- `PreviewCanvas`: Displays live preview with watermark
- `DownloadButton`: Handles image export

## Key Considerations
- All processing happens client-side (no server API routes needed)
- Uses canvas manipulation for watermark application
- Responsive design for various screen sizes
- Type safety with TypeScript interfaces

This application provides a complete client-side solution for image watermarking with an intuitive user interface and real-time preview capabilities.
